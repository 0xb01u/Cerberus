# Future features

This file records the planned features for Hermes, in a quick and dirty way.

## Team names

Renaming a team to show a cooler name in the leaderboard's snapshot.

### Team roles

Create role per team. Comfortably mention an entire team with that role.

## Position updates notifications

A way of notifying the students when a new team enters the leaderboard or beats their time.

## Server alias

Because "UVa\_-\_Computaci√≥n\_Paralela\_20/21" is too long and we all know it.

## Admin configuration

Any way for the admins/professors to manage the students' teams and other settings directly from Discord.

### Admin documentation

Document the admin's features.

### Admin configuration per guild

A way to set different configurations for different guilds on the same bot.

## Student identification

A way to keep track of which student (name and surnames) is which Discord user. Also, automatically giving them some kind of @Student rank.

## Team tracking

Get students that aren't part of any team.

## Admin contact

A way to contact the admins or the bot developer for help using the bot.

## Update notifyier

A way for Hermes to notify the admins whenever there's a new version of the software available for download.

## QoL / possible suggestions

I don't know, these will come up over time...

Maybe a way to count reactions. Or a way to make the students identify themselves before using the server. A way to make/store threads; a way to ask questions...

## Long term -- Overriding the python client

Just get rid of the python client and do the things directly from Discord/node.js!
