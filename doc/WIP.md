# Future features

This file records the planned features for Hermes, in a quick and dirty way.

## Leaderboard overview

A way of showing a summarized snapshot of the leaderboard(s) at a given moment in time, maybe updating periodically.

### Position updates notifications

A way of notifying the students when a new team enters the leaderboard or beats their time.

## Admin configuration

Any way for the admins/professors to manage the students' teams and other settings directly from Discord. Also, any way for the admins to change the bot's configuration directly from Discord, no need to restart.

## Admin contact

A way to contact the admins or the bot developer for help using the bot.

## Update notifyier

A way for Hermes to notify the admins whenever there's a new version of the software available for download.

## QoL / possible suggestions

I don't know, these will come up over time...

Maybe a way to count reactions. Or a way to make the students identify themselves before using the server. A way to make/store threads; a way to ask questions...

## Long term -- Overriding the python client

Just get rid of the python client and do the things directly from Discord/node.js!
